- **Domain**: `www.sophia-intel.ai` (production ready)
- **8 Core Services**: All operational with health checks
- **Monitoring Stack**: Complete (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, cAdvisor, Node Exporter)
- **Resource Allocation**: Properly configured for production workloads

### Service Architecture
```
Frontend: sophia-dashboard (React + Vite, Port 3000)
MCP Services: research, context, github, business, lambda, hubspot, agents
Backend Jobs: sophia-jobs (background processing)
Reverse Proxy: nginx-proxy (SSL termination, load balancing)
Monitoring: Complete observability stack
```

## 3. Kubernetes Migration Framework ✅

### K3s Cluster Planning
- **Target Platform**: K3s on Lambda Labs GPU instance
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA GPU Operator integration
- **Ingress Controller**: nginx-ingress with SSL/TLS
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for embeddings and data
- **Monitoring**: Kubernetes-native monitoring stack

### Service Manifests Status
- **Complete Coverage**: All 14 manifests prepared
- **Resource Allocation**: GPU distribution strategy defined
- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness probes configured
- **Secrets Management**: Kubernetes secrets integration ready
- **Domain Routing**: Ingress with path-based routing configured

### GPU Distribution Strategy
```
mcp-research: 1 GPU (AI research and processing)
mcp-context: 1 GPU (embeddings and vector operations)
mcp-agents: 1 GPU (agent coordination and reasoning)
Dashboard: CPU only (frontend application)
Other services: CPU optimized (business logic, APIs)
```

## 4. Migration Path Analysis ✅

### Current State → Target State
```
Docker Compose (Single Node)
├── 8 MCP Services + Monitoring
├── Manual scaling and deployment
└── Limited high availability

Kubernetes/K3s (Single Node)
├── Same services with improved orchestration
├── Automated scaling and self-healing
├── GPU resource management
├── Advanced monitoring and logging
└── Production-grade deployment patterns
```

### Migration Strategy
1. **Zero Downtime Approach**: Deploy K8s alongside Docker Compose
2. **Gradual Cutover**: Service-by-service migration with health verification
3. **Rollback Capability**: Complete rollback procedures documented
4. **Data Migration**: Persistent volume migration for embeddings/Qdrant

## 5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation ✅

### Critical Risks Identified
1. **GPU Resource Contention**: Mitigation - Dedicated GPU allocation per service
2. **Data Migration Complexity**: Mitigation - Qdrant/Redis volume migration strategy
3. **DNS Cutover Timing**: Mitigation - Pre-warming and health check validation
4. **Service Discovery Changes**: Mitigation - Internal DNS and service mesh preparation

### Low-Risk Items
- Configuration translation (manifests already prepared)
- SSL certificate migration (cert-manager ready)
- Monitoring stack migration (K8s-native alternatives available)

## 6. Phased Rollout Strategy ✅

### Phase 2A: Infrastructure Setup (1-2 weeks)
- K3s installation with GPU support
- Persistent storage provisioning
- nginx-ingress deployment
- Basic monitoring setup

### Phase 2B: Service Migration (2-3 weeks)
- Stateless services first (dashboard, APIs)
- Stateful services second (context, research with data migration)
- Gradual traffic shifting with health validation
- Full production testing

### Phase 2C: Optimization (1 week)
- Performance tuning and resource optimization
- Advanced monitoring configuration
- Documentation updates

### Phase 2D: Decommission (1 day)
- Docker Compose shutdown
- Final DNS updates
- Legacy resource cleanup

## 7. Optimization Recommendations ✅

### Immediate Actions (Phase 2)
1. **GPU Optimization**: Implement GPU sharing for development environments
2. **Resource Tuning**: Right-size CPU/memory based on actual usage patterns
3. **Network Optimization**: Implement service mesh for inter-service communication
4. **Storage Optimization**: SSD-based persistent volumes for vector databases

### Long-term Improvements (Phase 3+)
1. **Multi-zone Deployment**: Expand to multiple Lambda Labs instances
2. **Advanced Auto-scaling**: HPA/VPA for dynamic resource management
3. **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances and reserved capacity planning
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region backup and recovery procedures

## 8. Timeline and Dependencies ✅

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 2A**: 1-2 weeks (Infrastructure)
- **Phase 2B**: 2-3 weeks (Migration)
- **Phase 2C**: 1 week (Optimization)
- **Phase 2D**: 1 day (Decommission)
- **Total**: 4-6 weeks to full migration

### Key Dependencies
- **GPU Availability**: Lambda Labs instance with sufficient GPU capacity
- **Domain Access**: DNS management access for cutover
- **SSL Certificates**: Let's Encrypt integration testing
- **Data Backup**: Complete backup of Qdrant/Redis before migration

## 9. Success Metrics ✅
