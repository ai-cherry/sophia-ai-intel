## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Architecture Patterns
- **FastAPI Framework**: 80% of services use FastAPI with uvicorn
- **Health Endpoints**: Standardized `/healthz` endpoints across all services
- **Environment Variables**: Consistent secret management via Kubernetes
- **Resource Allocation**: CPU/memory limits based on service requirements
- **Networking**: ClusterIP services with ingress integration

### Docker Build System
- **Template Location**: `services/*/Dockerfile` (shared template with service-specific args)
- **Build Arguments**:
  - `SERVICE_REQUIREMENTS_PATH` - Service-specific requirements file
  - `SERVICE_SOURCE_PATH` - Service source code location
  - `PYTHON_VERSION` - Python version (default: 3.11-slim)
- **Security Features**:
  - Non-root user execution
  - Minimal base images
  - No unnecessary packages in runtime

### Kubernetes Manifest Standards
- **Naming Convention**: `mcp-[service].yaml`
- **Resource Standards**:
  - CPU: 100m request, 500m limit (configurable per service)
  - Memory: 128Mi request, 512Mi limit (configurable per service)
- **Probes Configuration**:
  - Initial delay: 30s (liveness), 5s (readiness)
  - Period: 10s (liveness), 5s (readiness)
  - Timeout: 5s (liveness), 3s (readiness)
