# Sophia AI Structural Improvement Analysis Prompt

## Objective
Perform a deep structural analysis of the Sophia AI repository to identify architectural improvements, code organization optimizations, and technical debt reduction opportunities beyond the initial maintenance review.

## Analysis Scope

### 1. Service Architecture Patterns
Analyze the current microservices architecture for:
- **Service Granularity**: Are services appropriately sized or over/under-decomposed?
- **Service Boundaries**: Clear separation of concerns vs. blurred responsibilities
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common libraries and their usage patterns
- **API Consistency**: RESTful design patterns across services
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized vs. distributed configuration approaches

### 2. Code Organization & Structure
Evaluate the codebase for:
- **Directory Structure**: Logical organization and naming conventions
- **File Naming Patterns**: Consistency across services and components
- **Import/Export Patterns**: Circular dependencies and import optimization
- **Module Boundaries**: Clear separation between business logic, infrastructure, and utilities
- **Test Structure**: Test organization and coverage patterns

### 3. Infrastructure & Deployment Patterns
Review infrastructure components for:
- **Docker Image Optimization**: Layer caching, multi-stage builds, base image consistency
- **Kubernetes Manifest DRYness**: Template usage and manifest duplication
- **Environment Configuration**: Secrets management, environment variables, configuration files
- **CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency**: Build times, caching, parallelization opportunities
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Consistent metrics, logging, and tracing across services

### 4. Data & State Management
Analyze data handling patterns:
- **Database Schema Consistency**: Naming conventions, indexing strategies
- **Migration Patterns**: Version control and deployment strategies
- **Caching Strategies**: Redis usage patterns, cache invalidation
- **State Management**: Session handling, stateful vs stateless services
- **Data Flow**: ETL pipelines, data consistency across services

### 5. Security & Compliance
Review security implementations:
- **Authentication Patterns**: JWT handling, service-to-service auth
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables, Kubernetes secrets, external secret stores
- **Network Security**: Service mesh, network policies, TLS configuration
- **Access Control**: RBAC implementation, principle of least privilege

### 6. Performance & Scalability
Identify performance bottlenecks:
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, network efficiency
- **Scaling Patterns**: Horizontal vs vertical scaling strategies
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution and health checks
- **Caching Layers**: CDN, application-level, database query optimization

### 7. Development Experience
Evaluate developer productivity:
- **Local Development**: Docker compose, hot reloading, debugging
- **Documentation**: API docs, architecture decisions, onboarding guides
- **Tooling**: Linting, formatting, testing frameworks
- **Build Times**: Dependency management, incremental builds

## Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Static Analysis
1. **Code Metrics**: Lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, duplication
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod analysis
3. **File Patterns**: Naming conventions, file organization
4. **Configuration Drift**: Environment-specific configuration differences

### Phase 2: Dynamic Analysis
1. **Runtime Behavior**: Service startup times, memory usage patterns
2. **Network Analysis**: Service communication patterns, latency
3. **Resource Usage**: Container resource limits vs actual usage
4. **Error Patterns**: Log analysis, error frequency, retry patterns

### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis
1. **Industry Standards**: Compare against microservices best practices
2. **Similar Systems**: Benchmark against comparable AI platforms
3. **Tooling Comparison**: Evaluate current tools vs alternatives
4. **Cost Analysis**: Infrastructure costs vs performance trade-offs

## Specific Investigation Areas

- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Observability**: Metrics, tracing, logging consistency
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings management
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts
- **Deployment**: Blue-green, canary, rolling updates

### Infrastructure Patterns
- **Container Images**: Base image consistency, security scanning
