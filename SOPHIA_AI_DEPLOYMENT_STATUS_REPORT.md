# Sophia AI Deployment Status Report

**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Domain:** sophia-intel.ai  
**Target Server:** Lambda Labs (192.222.51.223)

## Deployment Summary

### ‚úÖ Deployment Script Executed
The production deployment script was run with your DNSimple credentials:
- **DNSimple Token:** Configured
- **Account ID:** musillynn
- **Script:** `./scripts/deploy-to-production.sh`

### üìã What the Deployment Script Does

1. **DNS Configuration via DNSimple API**
   - Updates A records for sophia-intel.ai
   - Configures www.sophia-intel.ai ‚Üí 192.222.51.223
   - Sets up api.sophia-intel.ai ‚Üí 192.222.51.223

2. **Lambda Labs Deployment**
   - Connects to ubuntu@192.222.51.223
   - Clones/updates the repository
   - Installs K3s (Kubernetes) if not present
   - Creates sophia namespace
   - Deploys all services via Kubernetes manifests
   - Configures SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
   - Sets up ingress for domain routing

### üîç Current Status

Based on the deployment script execution:

1. **DNS Updates**: The script has sent DNS update requests to DNSimple
2. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Script is deploying services to Lambda Labs
3. **SSL Configuration**: Let's Encrypt certificates are being configured

### ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Timeline

- **DNS Propagation**: 5-15 minutes (can take up to 48 hours globally)
- **Service Startup**: 5-10 minutes for all pods to be ready
- **SSL Certificate**: 2-5 minutes for Let's Encrypt validation

### üîß Manual Verification Steps

To confirm deployment health:

1. **Check DNS propagation:**
   ```bash
   dig www.sophia-intel.ai
   # Should return: 192.222.51.223
   ```

2. **SSH to Lambda Labs (if you have access):**
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@192.222.51.223
   kubectl get pods -n sophia
   # Should show all pods Running
   ```

3. **Test endpoints (after DNS propagates):**
   ```bash
   curl https://www.sophia-intel.ai/healthz
   curl https://api.sophia-intel.ai/healthz
   ```

### üìå Important Notes

1. **SSH Access**: The deployment script requires SSH access to Lambda Labs. If you haven't configured SSH keys, you'll need to:
   - Add your public SSH key to the Lambda Labs server
   - Or run the deployment manually via Lambda Labs console

2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env.production` file contains all required API keys for the services to function properly

3. **First-time Deployment**: If this is the first deployment, it may take longer as:
   - K3s needs to be installed
   - All Docker images need to be built
   - SSL certificates need to be generated

### üö® Troubleshooting

If services are not accessible:

1. **DNS not resolved yet**: Wait for propagation
2. **SSH access denied**: Configure SSH keys with Lambda Labs
3. **Services not running**: Check Kubernetes pod status
4. **SSL errors**: Let's Encrypt may need time to validate

### üìä Service Status Check Commands

Once DNS propagates, verify each service:

```bash
# Main dashboard
curl -I https://www.sophia-intel.ai/healthz

# API services
curl https://api.sophia-intel.ai/mcp-research/healthz
curl https://api.sophia-intel.ai/mcp-context/healthz
curl https://api.sophia-intel.ai/mcp-agents/healthz
```

## Next Actions

1. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for DNS propagation and service startup
2. **Test the endpoints** listed above
3. **Monitor pod status** via SSH if you have access
4. **Check application logs** if any services fail health checks

The deployment process has been initiated. Full availability depends on DNS propagation and service initialization time.
