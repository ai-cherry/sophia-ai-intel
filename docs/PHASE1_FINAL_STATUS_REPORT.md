## ⚠️ CURRENT BLOCKERS

### **Primary Blocker: Fly.io Authentication**
The main blocker is Fly.io CLI authentication in the deployment environment. Multiple tokens have been provided but authentication continues to fail.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ✅ Updated GitHub organization secrets with fresh tokens
2. ✅ Used browser authentication flow
3. ✅ Tried multiple token formats
4. ✅ Updated to Pay Ready organization tokens

**Current Status:** GitHub Actions deployment fails on Fly.io authentication

### **Secondary Issues:**
1. **App Naming Consistency**: Resolved - reverted to original naming convention
2. **Cryptography Dependencies**: Resolved - added proper JWT crypto support
3. **GitHub App Webhook**: Resolved - updated to correct endpoint
