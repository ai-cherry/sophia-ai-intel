**Content Architecture Review:**
- Does documentation follow consistent format/template?
- Are there appropriate headers, sections, and subsections?
- Is there proper use of markdown formatting for readability?
- Are code examples properly formatted and highlighted?

#### **3. CONTENT QUALITY ANALYSIS**
**For each document, evaluate:**

**Accuracy & Currency:**
- Compare documentation against actual code implementation
- Identify outdated information, dead links, incorrect commands
- Check if environment variables, API endpoints, and configurations are current
- Verify that installation/setup steps actually work

**Completeness Assessment:**
- Are prerequisites clearly stated?
- Do setup guides include all necessary steps?
- Are troubleshooting sections comprehensive?

- Are technical concepts explained appropriately for the audience?
- Is there appropriate use of examples, diagrams, and code snippets?
- Are instructions step-by-step and unambiguous?

#### **4. DOCUMENT CATEGORIZATION**
**Classify each document:**

**Document Types:**
- **Architecture**: High-level system design documents
- **Setup/Installation**: Getting started guides
- **API Documentation**: Service interfaces and endpoints
- **Deployment**: Infrastructure and deployment procedures
- **Operations**: Monitoring, troubleshooting, maintenance
- **Development**: Contributing guidelines, coding standards
- **Business**: Requirements, specifications, decisions
- **Historical**: Event logs, completion reports, migration notes

**Document Lifecycle:**
- **Living Documents**: Should be regularly updated (README, API docs)
- **Reference Documents**: Stable reference material (architecture, decisions)
- **One-Time Documents**: Historical records (migration logs, completion reports)
- **Deprecated Documents**: Outdated content that should be archived/removed

#### **5. GAP ANALYSIS**
**Identify missing documentation:**

**Essential Missing Documentation:**
- User guides for end-users vs. developers
- API reference documentation
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Security and compliance documentation  
- Performance optimization guides
- Contributing guidelines for new developers
- Service integration documentation

**Development Process Documentation:**
- Code review processes
- Testing procedures and standards
- Release and deployment procedures
- Incident response procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup

#### **6. CONSISTENCY AUDIT**
**Check for consistency across all documentation:**

**Style & Format Consistency:**
- Markdown formatting standards
- Code block language specifications
- Header hierarchy and numbering
- Link formats (relative vs. absolute)
- Image and diagram standards

**Content Consistency:**
- Terminology usage across documents
- Code examples match current implementation
- Version numbers and dependencies are current
- Environment variable names and values
- URL endpoints and service names

**Maintenance Consistency:**
- Documentation update dates
- Author attribution consistency
- Version control integration
- Review and approval processes
