# Swarm Charter - Sophia AI Intelligence System

## Mission Statement

The Sophia AI swarm operates as a distributed intelligence system with specialized agents collaborating to deliver enterprise-grade AI capabilities while maintaining strict operational discipline and proof-first methodology.

## Core Principles

### 1. Proof-First Operations
- **NO MOCKS**: All operations must produce real artifacts or normalized error JSON
- **Artifact Commitment**: All proofs committed under `proofs/*` and `docs/*` 
- **Traceability**: Every decision documented with reasoning and evidence

### 2. Distributed Specialization
- **Role Clarity**: Each agent has defined expertise boundaries
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Structured handoffs with context preservation
- **Fail-Safe Isolation**: Agent failures don't cascade to other components

### 3. Enterprise Readiness
- **CEO-Gated Operations**: Critical infrastructure changes require executive approval
- **Security First**: No secret exposure in proofs or logs
- **Compliance**: All operations auditable and reversible

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### Core Agents

#### Planner Agent (Strategic)
- **Primary**: High-level task decomposition and resource allocation
- **Models**: Claude Sonnet 4.x (primary), GPT-5 (review)
- **Outputs**: Task breakdown, dependency mapping, risk assessment
- **Rollback**: Revert to previous approved plan state

#### Coder Agent (Implementation) 
- **Primary**: Code generation, testing, and integration
- **Models**: DeepSeek-Coder, Qwen-Coder (specialized tasks)
- **Outputs**: Production code, unit tests, integration proofs
- **Rollback**: Git-based revert with automated dependency analysis

#### Mediator Agent (Coordination)
- **Primary**: Inter-agent conflict resolution and workflow orchestration
- **Models**: GPT-5 (neutral arbitration)
- **Outputs**: Resolution decisions, workflow adjustments, escalation triggers
- **Rollback**: Restore previous stable workflow state

#### Context Agent (Memory)
- **Primary**: Information retrieval, indexing, and knowledge management
- **Models**: Embedding models + vector search
- **Outputs**: Relevant context, semantic search results, knowledge updates
- **Rollback**: Index state restoration with timestamp-based recovery

## Operational Rules

### 1. Task Execution Protocol
```yaml
workflow:
  initiate: Planner Agent creates task breakdown
  validate: Mediator Agent reviews for conflicts/resources
  execute: Specialized agents work in parallel where possible
  verify: All agents produce verification proofs
  commit: Artifacts committed with approval trail
```

### 2. Error Handling & Rollback
- **Immediate**: Stop execution on critical errors
- **Document**: Create normalized error JSON for all failures
- **Isolate**: Prevent error propagation to other agents
- **Recovery**: Automated rollback to last known good state

### 3. Communication Standards
- **Structured Handoffs**: JSON-formatted context transfers
- **Status Broadcasting**: Regular health/progress updates
- **Conflict Resolution**: Escalation to Mediator Agent
- **Audit Trail**: All inter-agent communications logged

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Execution Validation
- [ ] Task scope within agent capability boundaries
- [ ] Required resources available and allocated
- [ ] Dependencies resolved or properly sequenced
- [ ] Rollback plan defined and tested

### Post-Execution Verification
- [ ] All outputs meet quality standards
- [ ] Proofs generated and committed successfully
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with changes

### Emergency Protocols
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic halt on consecutive failures (>3)
- **Human Escalation**: CEO notification for critical system failures
- **State Preservation**: All partial work committed before shutdown
- **Recovery Planning**: Automated generation of recovery procedures

## Performance Metrics

### Agent Efficiency
- Task completion rate by agent type
- Mean time to resolution by complexity level
- Error rate and recovery time
- Resource utilization and cost optimization

### System Reliability
- Uptime percentage across all agents
- Successful rollback execution rate  
- Cross-agent communication success rate
- End-to-end workflow completion rate

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning Loop
1. **Collect**: Performance metrics and failure analysis
2. **Analyze**: Pattern recognition and bottleneck identification
3. **Adapt**: Agent capability updates and workflow optimization
4. **Validate**: A/B testing of improvements with rollback capability

### Knowledge Evolution
- Regular updating of agent training data
- Cross-pollination of successful strategies
- Documentation of edge cases and solutions
- Integration of external best practices
