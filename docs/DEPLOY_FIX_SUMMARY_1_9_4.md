# Deploy Fix Summary - Phase 1.9.4
**DNS Resolution Issue Root Cause Analysis & Resolution**

## Issue Diagnosed: App Name Mismatch

**Problem**: 4 of 5 services failing with DNS resolution errors (NXDOMAIN)
**Root Cause**: App names in `fly.toml` files didn't match canonical `-v2` naming expected by deployment workflow

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Canonical Naming Corrections
| Service | File | Previous Name | Fixed Name | Status |
|---------|------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Dashboard | `apps/dashboard/fly.toml` | `sophiaai-dashboard` | `sophiaai-dashboard-v2` | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Repository MCP | `services/mcp-github/fly.toml` | `sophiaai-mcp-repo` | `sophiaai-mcp-repo-v2` | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Research MCP | `services/mcp-research/fly.toml` | `sophiaai-mcp-research` | `sophiaai-mcp-research-v2` | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Business MCP | `services/mcp-business/fly.toml` | `sophiaai-mcp-business-v2` | `sophiaai-mcp-business-v2` | ‚úÖ Already Correct |
| Context MCP | `services/mcp-context/fly.toml` | `sophiaai-mcp-context` | `sophiaai-mcp-context-v2` | ‚úÖ Fixed |

### ‚úÖ HTTP Service Validation
All services confirmed to have:
- `internal_port = 8080`
- `/healthz` endpoint check configured
- Proper Machines platform configuration
- Force HTTPS enabled

## Pre-Deployment Status

### Infrastructure Ready
- **Secrets Mapping**: [`secrets_map.json`](.infra/secrets_map.json) - Complete 8-provider configuration
- **Deployment Workflow**: [`deploy_all.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy_all.yml) - QDRANT_ENDPOINT ‚Üí QDRANT_URL fix applied
- **Organization Target**: `pay-ready` with `FLY_TOKEN_PAY_READY`

### Service Configurations Validated
- **Deployment Matrix**: [`matrix.json`](proofs/deploy/matrix.json) - Complete service paths and configurations
- **TOML Validation**: [`toml_checks.json`](proofs/fly/toml_checks.json) - All http_service configurations valid
- **Naming Compliance**: 5/5 services now use canonical `-v2` naming

## Current Service Status

### ‚úÖ Deployed & Healthy
- **Repository MCP**: `https://sophiaai-mcp-repo-v2.fly.dev` - HTTP 200, 1.7B+ ms uptime

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Ready for Deployment (DNS will resolve post-deploy)
- **Dashboard**: `https://sophiaai-dashboard-v2.fly.dev`
- **Research MCP**: `https://sophiaai-mcp-research-v2.fly.dev`  
- **Business MCP**: `https://sophiaai-mcp-business-v2.fly.dev`
- **Context MCP**: `https://sophiaai-mcp-context-v2.fly.dev`

## Deployment Readiness

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites Complete
- [x] All fly.toml files have correct canonical `-v2` app names
- [x] All services configured for port 8080 with `/healthz` checks
- [x] Infrastructure secrets properly mapped
- [x] Deployment workflow validated with QDRANT_URL fix
- [x] Pay Ready organization target confirmed

### üöÄ Next Action Required
**CEO Manual Deployment Trigger**:
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/ai-cherry/sophia-ai-intel/actions/workflows/deploy_all.yml
2. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí Select `main` branch ‚Üí Run workflow
3. Expected: All 5 services deploy successfully with DNS resolution

## Expected Post-Deployment Results

### Service Health
- All 5 services return HTTP 200 at `/healthz` endpoints
- Dashboard serves React SPA with GTM tab
- All MCP services respond to provider verification

### Infrastructure Connectivity  
- Qdrant collections accessible and operational
- Redis TTL probing successful
- Neon database connectivity verified

### Provider Operations
- Research MCP `/providers` endpoint returns external API providers
- Business MCP `/providers` includes Telegram integration
- Context MCP indexing and search operations functional

## Architecture Impact

**Before Fix**: 1/5 services deployed (20% success rate)
**After Fix**: Expected 5/5 services deployed (100% success rate)

**Root Cause Resolution**: App name mismatches prevented proper DNS provisioning during deployment. With canonical `-v2` naming now enforced across all configurations, the deployment workflow will create apps with correct names and establish proper DNS routing.
