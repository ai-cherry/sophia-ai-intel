## üîß High-Impact Fixes

### Priority 1 - Critical
1. **Environment Variables**: Configure all required secrets in Fly.io
2. **Database Setup**: Ensure PostgreSQL is available for mcp-context
3. **API Keys**: Set up OpenAI and Portkey API keys

### Priority 2 - Important
1. **Type Errors**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors if present
2. **Lint Issues**: Address ESLint warnings
3. **Docker Optimization**: Multi-stage builds for smaller images

### Priority 3 - Nice to Have
1. **Test Coverage**: Add unit tests to packages
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate deployments
3. **Monitoring**: Add application monitoring

## üìã Next Actions

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. Review and fix any build failures in [npm_dashboard_build.txt](../proofs/assessment/npm_dashboard_build.txt)
2. Configure required environment variables
3. Set up GitHub App credentials

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Fix TypeScript and lint issues
2. Verify all Docker images build successfully
3. Test MCP services with actual credentials

### Long-term (This Month)
1. Implement comprehensive testing
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Document deployment procedures
