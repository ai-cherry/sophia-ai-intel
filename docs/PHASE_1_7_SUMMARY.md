# Phase 1.7 Summary - Dashboard Build Fix & Deployment Attempts

## Timestamp
2025-08-22T18:03:00Z

## Objectives
1. Fix dashboard build issues in CI/CD
2. Trigger deployment workflow
3. Collect proof artifacts

## Completed Work

### ✅ Secrets Configuration (Phase 1.6 completion)
All required secrets have been added to GitHub Actions:
- `FLY_API_TOKEN`: fly_pat_9bvEjpZdQOqkLo3VZvRO75MBBzj1G1VH1GW6pKXvzKTnZCnz
- `NEON_DATABASE_URL`: postgresql://sophia_owner:***@ep-bold-wave-a5mhrqxr.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/sophia?sslmode=require
- `NEON_API_TOKEN`: neon_api_***
- `GH_APP_ID`: 1821931
- `GH_INSTALLATION_ID`: 58498023
- `PORTKEY_API_KEY`: (configured)

### ✅ Fly.io Apps Setup
All required apps exist on Fly.io:
- sophiaai-dashboard (https://sophiaai-dashboard.fly.dev)
- sophiaai-mcp-repo (https://sophiaai-mcp-repo.fly.dev)
- sophiaai-mcp-research (https://sophiaai-mcp-research.fly.dev)
- sophiaai-mcp-context (https://sophiaai-mcp-context.fly.dev)

### ✅ Workflow Configuration
The `deploy_all.yml` workflow already includes:
- Node.js v20 setup
- Root workspace installation (`npm ci --workspaces`)
- Shared libs build (contracts/clients)
- Proper build order and dependencies

### ⚠️ Deployment Attempts
Multiple deployment attempts have been made:

#### Run #17162233137 (2025-08-22T17:47:45Z)
- **Status**: Failed
- **Issue**: Dashboard and MCP services deployment failed
- **Preflight**: Passed (FLY_API_TOKEN verified)

#### Run #17162486592 (2025-08-22T18:01:20Z)
- **Status**: Failed
- **Issue**: Same failure pattern
- **Details**:
  - Preflight: Success
  - Dashboard deployment: Failed (within 4 seconds)
  - MCP services: Failed/Cancelled
  - Summary: Skipped

## Root Cause Analysis

### Identified Issues
1. **Fly.io Authentication**: While FLY_API_TOKEN exists and preflight passes, the actual deployment steps fail immediately
2. **Rapid Failure**: Jobs fail within 3-5 seconds, suggesting authentication or configuration issues rather than build problems
3. **Pattern**: Both dashboard and MCP services fail with the same pattern

### Likely Causes
1. **FLY_API_TOKEN permissions**: The token might not have deployment permissions for the apps
2. **Fly.io organization mismatch**: Apps might belong to a different organization than the token
3. **Missing docker-compose installation**: Although workflow includes `setup-docker-compose@master`, it might be failing silently

## Proof Artifacts Created

### Deployment Proofs
- `proofs/fly/app_setup.log` - Fly.io app verification log
- `proofs/fly/apps_created.json` - Apps existence confirmation
- `proofs/deployment/workflow_triggered_phase17.json` - Deployment trigger record
- `proofs/deployment/workflow_failure_analysis.json` - Failure analysis
- `proofs/build/dashboard_failure_phase17.json` - Dashboard build failure record

### Configuration Proofs
- `proofs/secrets/matrix.json` - Environment variable mapping
- `proofs/github_app/configuration.json` - GitHub App details
- `proofs/neon/configuration.json` - Database configuration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Verify FLY_API_TOKEN permissions**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose auth whoami
   docker-compose apps list
   ```

2. **Check app ownership**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose apps show sophiaai-dashboard
   ```

3. **Manual deployment test**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/dashboard
   docker-compose deploy --local-only
   ```

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Generate new FLY_API_TOKEN** with full permissions
2. **Transfer apps** to the organization that owns the token
3. **Create new apps** under the correct organization
4. **Debug workflow** by adding more verbose logging to deployment steps

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Fix deployment)
1. Regenerate FLY_API_TOKEN with proper permissions
2. Add debug logging to workflow deployment steps
3. Test manual deployment locally first
4. Consider using `docker-compose deploy --local-only` to avoid Docker registry issues

### Long-term (Improve reliability)
1. Add pre-deployment validation steps
2. Implement deployment rollback mechanism
3. Add monitoring and alerting for deployments
4. Create deployment runbook documentation

## Summary
Phase 1.7 successfully identified and attempted to fix the dashboard build issues (npm workspace installation was already present in the workflow). However, the deployment to Fly.io continues to fail due to authentication or permission issues with the FLY_API_TOKEN. The infrastructure is ready (apps exist, secrets configured), but the deployment mechanism needs troubleshooting.

## Status: Partially Complete
- ✅ Dashboard build fix identified (already in workflow)
- ✅ All secrets configured
- ✅ Fly.io apps created
- ❌ Deployment execution failing
- ⚠️ Proof artifacts partially collected (no successful deployment proofs)
