# Agno AI Integration Plan v2

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical blueprint for the integration of Agno AI capabilities into our platform via a new, unified `agentic` service. This service will house all swarm-based capabilities, providing a centralized and scalable architecture for advanced AI operations.

## 2. Unified `agentic` Service Architecture

The `agentic` service will be a standalone, top-level service designed for modularity and scalability. It will expose a unified API for interacting with various AI swarms and will be responsible for orchestrating complex, multi-agent workflows.

## 3. Hierarchical Coding Swarms

-   **Objective:** To automate code generation, review, and repository management.
-   **Structure:** A multi-layered swarm architecture:
    -   **L1 (Architect Swarm):** Designs high-level code structure and delegates tasks.
    -   **L2 (Developer Swarms):** Implement specific features or modules based on L1 specifications.
    -   **L3 (Code Review & Testing Swarm):** A specialized swarm for automated code review, testing, and quality assurance.
-   **Directory:** `agentic/coding_swarms/`

## 4. Enhanced Deep-Research Scraping Swarm

-   **Objective:** To perform in-depth, context-aware research and data extraction from various online sources.
-   **Capabilities:**
    -   Advanced scraping techniques to bypass common obstacles.
    -   Natural language understanding (NLU) to synthesize and summarize findings.
    -   Continuous monitoring of sources for updated information.
-   **Directory:** `agentic/research_swarms/`

## 5. Business-Intelligence Swarms

-   **Objective:** To automate the analysis of business data and generate actionable insights.
-   **Integrations:** Will connect to internal and external data sources (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, internal databases).
-   **Capabilities:**
    -   Trend analysis and forecasting.
    -   Anomaly detection.
    -   Automated report generation.
-   **Directory:** `agentic/business_swarms/`

## 6. Process Orchestrator for CI/CD Integration

-   **Objective:** To create a robust process orchestrator that integrates AI-driven development with our existing CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Manages the lifecycle of agentic tasks.
    -   Triggers CI/CD pipelines upon successful task completion.
    -   Handles rollbacks and error notifications.
-   **Directory:** `agentic/process_orchestration/`

## 7. Agno UI Integration Strategy

-   **Objective:** To provide a seamless user interface for interacting with the `agentic` service.
-   **Implementation:** A dedicated service will be created to house the Agno UI components. This will allow for independent development and deployment of the user-facing aspects of the platform.
-   **Directory:** `agentic/ui/`

## 8. Indexing and Context Strategy

-   **Objective:** To build a robust and efficient system for indexing and retrieving contextual information to support swarm operations.
-   **Components:**
    -   **Vector Store:** For semantic search and retrieval of unstructured data.
    -   **Knowledge Graph:** To model relationships between entities and provide structured context.
    -   **Indexing Service:** A dedicated service for creating and maintaining the indexes.

## 9. Deployment and Testing Plan

-   **Staging & Production Environments:** The `agentic` service will be deployed to both staging and production environments to ensure stability and reliability.
-   **Deployment Platform:** Initial deployments will target **Fly.io** for rapid iteration and serverless capabilities.
-   **GPU-Intensive Workloads:** GPU-dependent tasks and models will be deployed to **Lambda Labs** to leverage specialized hardware.
-   **Testing:** A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for all swarm capabilities.
