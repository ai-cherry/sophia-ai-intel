# üîç Deep Research Prompt: Lambda Labs + Pulumi + GitHub Actions Deployment

## üéØ Research Objective
Comprehensive analysis of deployment issues and best practices for:
- **GitHub Actions** + **Pulumi Cloud** + **Lambda Labs** integration
- Troubleshooting persistent "Set Pulumi config values" failures
- Optimal deployment architectures for GPU-accelerated microservices

---

## üîß Current Technical Context

### **Our Stack:**
- **Infrastructure**: Lambda Labs GPU instances (A100)
- **Orchestration**: Pulumi Cloud (Infrastructure as Code)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose
- **Services**: 9 microservices (Python FastAPI + React dashboard)
- **External Dependencies**: Neon PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant Vector DB

### **Persistent Issues:**
1. **"Set Pulumi config values" step fails** in GitHub Actions even with secrets configured
2. **Lambda Labs API integration** challenges with Pulumi
3. **pulumi-lambdalabs provider doesn't exist** - need alternative approaches
4. **GitHub Secrets ‚Üí Pulumi config** pipeline not working reliably

### **Current Deployment Code:**
```python
# ops/pulumi/__main__.py - Our current approach
import pulumi
from pulumi_command import remote

config = pulumi.Config()
lambda_api_key = config.require_secret("lambda-api-key")  # THIS FAILS
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy_pulumi.yml - Current workflow
- name: Set Pulumi config values
  run: |
    pulumi config set lambda-api-key "${{ secrets.LAMBDA_API_KEY }}" --secret  # THIS FAILS
```
