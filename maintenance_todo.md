# Sophia AI Repository Maintenance Protocol - Todo List

## Phase 1: Safe Refactoring Assessment
- [ ] Identify duplicate code patterns across services
- [ ] Review service implementations for common functionality extraction
- [ ] Check for inconsistent naming conventions
- [ ] Evaluate Dockerfiles for consolidation opportunities
- [ ] Review configuration management patterns
- [ ] Identify error handling standardization opportunities

## Phase 2: Archived File Deletion Protocol
- [ ] Review docs/archive/ directory for cleanup
- [ ] Check backups/ directory for old deployment backups
- [ ] Verify proofs/ directory for outdated proof files
- [ ] Audit documentation for obsolete procedures
- [ ] Identify redundant manifest files with "fixed" or "corrected" names

## Phase 3: Syntax and Linter Validation
- [ ] Execute Python linting (flake8, pylint, black)
- [ ] Execute TypeScript/JavaScript linting (eslint)
- [ ] Validate YAML syntax for Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Check Dockerfile syntax consistency
- [ ] Validate JSON/YAML configuration files
- [ ] Execute static code analysis on critical services

## Phase 4: Conflict and Circular Reference Detection
- [ ] Search for Git conflict markers in source files
- [ ] Detect circular imports in Python modules
- [ ] Analyze dependency cycles in Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Check for circular references in Pulumi configurations
- [ ] Verify environment variable dependencies

## Phase 5: Health Verification Procedures
- [ ] Validate deployment manifests against current K8s API versions
- [ ] Check service account and RBAC configurations
- [ ] Verify secret references in manifests
- [ ] Validate Ingress configurations
- [ ] Check PersistentVolume configurations
- [ ] Verify monitoring and alerting configurations

## Phase 6: Documentation and Reporting
- [ ] Generate comprehensive maintenance report
- [ ] Document all changes made
- [ ] Create backup of files before deletion
- [ ] Update repository documentation
