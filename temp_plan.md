# Agno AI Integration Plan

This document outlines the technical plan for integrating Agno AI into the `sophia-ai-intel` monorepo.

## 1. Repository Discovery and Conflict Resolution

- **Objective**: Analyze the existing Agno services and define a unified architecture.
- **Methodology**:
  - Review the source code of `agno-coordinator`, `agno-teams`, and `agno-wrappers`.
  - Identify core functionalities, design patterns, and dependencies.
  - Propose a consolidated architecture that eliminates redundancy and technical debt.

## 2. Agno Setup and Code Planning

- **Objective**: Define the structure and roadmap for the new `agentic` service.
- **Methodology**:
  - Create a new `agentic` service in the `services` directory.
  - Implement a modular design that supports multiple agent swarms.
  - Define the initial data models and schemas for each swarm.

## 3. Design and Implement Agno Swarms

- **Objective**: Develop and integrate the Coding and Research Swarms.
- **Methodology**:
  - Implement the Coding Swarm with tools for code generation, testing, and debugging.
  - Implement the Research Swarm with capabilities for web scraping, data analysis, and report generation.
  - Integrate each swarm into the `agentic` service as a separate module.

## 4. Agno UI Integration

- **Objective**: Connect the Agno agents to the Sophia AI frontend.
- **Methodology**:
  - Develop a new API endpoint for the `agentic` service.
  - Create a new UI component in the dashboard to interact with the Agno agents.
  - Implement real-time communication using WebSockets.

## 5. Testing, CI/CD, and Repository Cleanup

- **Objective**: Ensure the stability and reliability of the new `agentic` service.
- **Methodology**:
  - Write unit and integration tests for each swarm.
  - Create a new CI/CD pipeline for the `agentic` service.
  - Remove the legacy `agno-coordinator`, `agno-teams`, and `agno-wrappers` services.
