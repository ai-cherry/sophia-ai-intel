# GitHub App Creation Status

## Progress

- ✅ Description: Read-only GitHub App for repository access
- ✅ Homepage URL: https://github.com/ai-cherry/sophia-ai-intel

- ⚠️ Repository Permissions: Need to expand and configure

## Required Permissions
- Contents: Read (to access repository files)
- Metadata: Read (to access repository metadata)

## Issue
The repository permissions section is not expanding properly when clicked. This may require:
1. Manual configuration via browser
2. Using GitHub CLI/API after creation
3. User takeover to complete setup

## Next Steps
1. Try to create the app with minimal permissions
2. Configure permissions after creation
3. Generate private key and installation ID
4. Update MCP service with credentials
