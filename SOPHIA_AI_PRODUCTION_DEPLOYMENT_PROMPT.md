## Task: Production Deployment Finalization & Cleanup

Perform a comprehensive production deployment readiness assessment and system cleanup to achieve **PRODUCTION READY** status. This involves:

### 1. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION

**Immediate Production Setup Tasks:**
- Generate secure production secrets using existing `scripts/generate-production-secrets.py`
- Apply standardized dependencies across all services using `requirements-standardized.txt`
- Deploy core infrastructure components (Redis event bus, databases, monitoring)
- Deploy and test all 29 microservices with health check validation
- Configure external integrations (DNS, SSL certificates, load balancing)
- Validate end-to-end system functionality in production environment

**Verification Requirements:**
- All services respond to health endpoints (`/health`, `/health/quick`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`)
- External API integrations functional (OpenAI, HubSpot, Salesforce, Gong, GitHub)
- Database connections established (Redis, Qdrant, PostgreSQL/Neon)
- Monitoring stack operational (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)
- Dashboard accessible and functional

### 2. COMPREHENSIVE CODE CLEANUP

**Dead Code Elimination:**
- Identify and remove duplicate/obsolete files (multiple versions of same functionality)
- Clean up abandoned experiment files and temporary implementations
- Remove unused dependencies from all `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` files
- Eliminate orphaned configuration files and deprecated scripts
- Clean up test files that are no longer relevant or functional

**Code Consolidation:**
- Merge duplicate implementations (e.g., multiple health check scripts, deployment scripts)
- Standardize naming conventions across all services and components
- Consolidate configuration files where appropriate
- Remove debugging artifacts and temporary patches
- Clean up import statements and unused code blocks

**Architecture Simplification:**
- Identify services that can be merged or eliminated
- Remove redundant abstraction layers
- Simplify overly complex configurations
- Standardize service interfaces and communication patterns
- Eliminate experimental features that aren't production-ready

### 3. DOCUMENTATION CONSOLIDATION & UPDATE

**Documentation Audit:**
- Review all markdown files in `/docs` directory for accuracy and relevance
- Identify outdated documentation that references old implementations
- Remove duplicate documentation covering the same topics
- Consolidate fragmented documentation into coherent guides

**Documentation Updates Required:**
- Update `README.md` with current architecture and deployment instructions
- Refresh all service-specific README files with accurate setup instructions
- Update deployment guides to reflect current Kubernetes configuration
- Revise API documentation to match implemented endpoints
- Update troubleshooting guides with current issues and solutions

**Documentation Standardization:**
- Establish consistent documentation structure across all services
- Standardize code examples and configuration snippets
- Ensure all external dependencies and requirements are documented
- Create clear onboarding guides for new developers
- Document production deployment procedures and rollback strategies

### 4. PRODUCTION READINESS VERIFICATION

**Infrastructure Testing:**
- Load testing using existing `scripts/load_testing/` framework
- Failover testing for critical services
- Database performance and connection pooling validation
- Network security and SSL certificate validation
- Backup and disaster recovery procedure testing

**Security Hardening:**
- Security vulnerability scanning using existing `scripts/security-scan.sh`
- API authentication and authorization testing
- Secrets management validation in production environment
- Network policies and RBAC configuration verification
- Container security and image scanning

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Configure production alerting rules and notification channels
- Set up log aggregation and analysis
- Implement performance metrics collection
- Configure distributed tracing across services
- Test incident response procedures

### 5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

**Service Optimization:**
- Profile CPU and memory usage across all services
- Optimize database queries and connection pooling
- Configure appropriate resource limits and requests in Kubernetes
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Optimize container images for production (multi-stage builds, minimal base images)

**Infrastructure Optimization:**
- Configure horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) based on real metrics
- Optimize ingress and load balancing configuration
- Configure persistent volume performance characteristics
- Set up CDN and static asset optimization
- Implement proper log rotation and retention policies

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Production Deployment
