# Sophia AI Intel - Phase 1 Progress Update

**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Environment Variable Standardization
**Status**: COMPLETED (as per thread evidence)
- Standardized `NEON_DATABASE_URL` â†’ `DATABASE_URL` 
- Standardized `QDRANT_ENDPOINT` â†’ `QDRANT_URL`
- Updated both `mcp-context/app.py` and `mcp-context/enhanced_app.py`
- Implemented backwards compatibility with environment variable aliases

### âœ… Architectural Audit
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Comprehensive codebase analysis completed
- Critical issues identified and documented
- Created `SOPHIA_AI_ARCHITECTURAL_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- Created secure `.env.production.template`

## Remaining Phase 1 Tasks

### ðŸ”„ Security Remediation
- [ ] Remove production secrets from `.env.production` 
- [ ] Implement proper secret management system
- [ ] Rotate all exposed credentials
- [ ] Update deployment scripts to use secret injection

### ðŸ”„ Core Service Fixes
- [ ] Consolidate mcp-context to single implementation (app.py vs enhanced_app.py)
- [ ] Fix orchestrator TypeScript build issues
- [ ] Re-enable orchestrator service
- [ ] Standardize health check endpoints

### ðŸ”„ Deployment Unification
- [ ] Merge duplicate deployment scripts into unified pipeline
- [ ] Resolve nginx configuration conflicts
- [ ] Create unified CI/CD workflow
- [ ] Document deployment decision tree

## Alignment with Thread Todo List

The thread's todo list aligns with my architectural findings:

1. **nginx configuration conflicts** - Confirmed in audit (system vs container nginx)
2. **Merge duplicate deployment scripts** - Found 4+ deployment scripts
3. **Environment variable standardization** - âœ… COMPLETED per thread
4. **Consolidate MCP service versions** - Still needed for mcp-context
5. **Resolve orchestrator TypeScript issues** - Confirmed disabled in docker-compose
6. **Consolidate documentation** - Found 35+ fragmented docs
7. **Unified health check system** - Inconsistent implementations found

## Critical Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Remove exposed secrets from `.env.production`
   - All production API keys and credentials are currently exposed
   - DNSimple token hardcoded in `deploy-sophia-intel.ai.sh`

2. **HIGH**: Fix orchestrator service
   - Central coordination is offline
   - TypeScript build issues need resolution

3. **HIGH**: Consolidate mcp-context implementation
   - Choose between `app.py` and `enhanced_app.py`
   - Currently using `enhanced_app.py` in docker-compose

4. **MEDIUM**: Unify deployment pipeline
   - Too many deployment scripts causing confusion
   - Need single source of truth

## Recommendations

1. Continue with the systematic approach shown in the thread
2. Prioritize security fixes before other changes
3. Document each change as it's made
4. Test thoroughly after each modification
5. Use the created `.env.production.template` as the standard

The methodical approach demonstrated in the thread is excellent and should continue for the remaining tasks.
